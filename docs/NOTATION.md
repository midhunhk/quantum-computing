# Notation
Bra-ket notation, also known as Dirac notation, is a standard notation used in quantum mechanics to represent vectors and operators in a Hilbert space, particularly in the context of quantum states and quantum operators. It was introduced by physicist Paul Dirac and has become ubiquitous in quantum mechanics literature due to its simplicity and elegance.

In bra-ket notation:

- The symbol ∣⟩ (ket) represents a column vector (or ket vector) in a Hilbert space.
- The symbol ⟨∣ (bra) represents a row vector (or bra vector) in the conjugate Hilbert space.

Together, they form the inner product ⟨ψ∣ϕ⟩, where ψ and ϕ are quantum states represented by ket vectors.

Bra-ket notation is widely used in quantum mechanics to express quantum states, operators, and measurements concisely and elegantly. It simplifies the notation for quantum mechanical expressions and calculations, making it easier to work with complex quantum systems and operations.
